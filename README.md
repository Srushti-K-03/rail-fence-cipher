# Rail Fence Cipher 🔐

A simple Python implementation of the **Rail Fence Cipher**, a classical transposition cipher that rearranges characters in a zigzag pattern across multiple rails.

## ✨ Features
- Encrypts and decrypts text using Rail Fence Cipher logic.
- Easy to understand and run on VS Code or any Python IDE.

## 🧠 How It Works
Each letter of the message is written diagonally down and then up across a number of "rails". The ciphertext is obtained by reading row by row.

Example (3 rails):
H O L
E L W R D
L O
Ciphertext → `HOLELWRDLO`

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Save the code as `rail_fence_cipher.py`.
2. Run in VS Code terminal:
   ```bash
   python rail_fence_cipher.py
3.Follow on-screen instructions for encryption and decryption.
📂 Example

Input: HELLOWORLD
Output: HOLELWRDLO
